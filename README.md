# Number-Guessing-Game-Project-

A number guessing game is a simple yet engaging digital or paper-based game where the player attempts to guess a secret number selected by the system or another player. It's often used as a programming exercise for beginners or as a fun mental challenge.

🎮 How It Works
Setup

The game generates a random number within a defined range (e.g., 1 to 100)

Player is prompted to make guesses one at a time

Gameplay

After each guess, the system provides feedback:

“Too high” if the guess exceeds the target

“Too low” if it’s below the target

“Correct!” when the number is matched

Attempts Tracking

Counts the number of tries taken to reach the correct answer
